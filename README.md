# Python_For_Fun
## Description:
These are some useful projects for improving your Python skills. There are dozens of ways a problem can be implemented. Thus, it does not matter if your code is not similar to mine, feel free to develop your own version of the code.  
Note: an error may occur in some .py files if you run them in other developer tools rather than Jupyter Notebook
