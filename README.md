# Python_For_Fun
## Description:
These are some useful projects for improving your Python skills. There are dozens of ways a problem can be implemented. Thus, it does not matter if your code is not similar to mine, feel free to develop your own code version.  

## Projects:
1. Tic Tac Toe: <br>
A game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.
2. Black Jack: <br>
Here are the requirements: (you can add more options)
   * You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
   * The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
   * The player can stand or hit.
   * The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
   * You need to keep track of the player's total money.
   * You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

3. Dice Rolling Simulator: <br>
The dice is a simple cube that generates any number from 1 to 6, and the dice simulator is a computer model that rolls the dice for the user. A dice rolling simulator can be implemented in different ways by Python.

4. Binary Search: <br>
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. <br>
Note: You can add Reset button and change the Tic variable limit.
