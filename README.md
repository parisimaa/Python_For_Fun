# Python_For_Fun
## Description:
These are some useful projects for improving your Python skills. There are dozens of ways a problem can be implemented. Thus, it does not matter if your code is not similar to mine, feel free to develop your own code version.  

## Projects:
1. Tic Tac Toe: <br>
A game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.
2. Black Jack: <br>
Here are the requirements: (you can add more options)
   * You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
   * The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
   * The player can stand or hit.
   * The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
   * You need to keep track of the player's total money.
   * You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

3. Dice Rolling Simulator: <br>
The dice is a simple cube that generates any number from 1 to 6, and the dice simulator is a computer model that rolls the dice for the user. A dice rolling simulator can be implemented in different ways by Python.
